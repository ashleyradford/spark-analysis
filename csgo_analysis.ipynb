    "Damage and grenade entries on over 410k rounds played in competitive Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.<br>\n",
    "Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/skihikingkevin/csgo-matchmaking-damage\n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets include data from over 16,400 ESEA matches, as well as around 1,400 ranked matches, from the game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. All data was extracted from competitive matchmaking replays that were submitted to a site called csgo-stats. The author states that this data is meant for exploratory analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets provided include the following (where there are multiple files for some):\n",
    "- **esea_master_dmg_demos:** each row is a damage entry in which one player (or world) has dealt damage to another\n",
    "- **esea_master_grenades_demos:** each row is a grenade thrown entry in which one player has used a purchasable utility grenade\n",
    "- **esea_master_kills_demos:** each row is a kill entry\n",
    "- **esea_meta_demos:** each row is per round meta information (round winner, round time, etc) \n",
    "- **map_data:** in game map coordinates\n",
    "- **mm_grenades_demos:** each row is a grenade thrown entry in which one player has used a purchasable utility grenade\n",
    "- **mm_master_demos:** each row is a damage entry in which one player (or world) has dealt damage to another\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: all files beginning with \"esea\" are from ESEA matches ranging from pugs to scrims that were scraped during a period of two weeks in August 2018. Here, the player ranks are unknown, but they are presumably high ranked pro players.<br>\n",
    "The files beginning with \"mm\" are from matchmaking matches (ranked) with average ranks between gold nova 1 and legendary eagle master.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some **background info** on how the game works: it is a tactical shooter that involves two teams of 5. The games consist of at most 30 rounds with two 15 round halves. For the first half, one team starts as the \"terrorists\" in which they must take control of one of the enemy team's (the \"counter terrorists\") bomb sites and plant a bomb. To win, the bomb must either explode (not be defused by the \"counter terrorists\") or the \"terrorists\" must eliminate the entire enemy team. For the \"counter terrorists\" to win the round, they must either eliminate all the \"terrorists\" or defuse the planted bomb. After 15 rounds, the two teams swap sides. First team to win 16 rounds will win the entire game.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "CS:GO is one of the most popular tactical shooter games. I have personally never played it, instead I am more familiar with Valorant, which is also a tactical shooter but with added agent abilities (each character has special abilities only available to them, similar to games like Overwatch). Since Valorant's release, naturally, there has been much debate about which game is better. I had originally hoped to analyze Valorant data, however, either because Valorant is too new of a game (3 years old) or Riot is very stingy with their data, I could not find sufficient data. I hope to use this data to see how similar these games are while also extracting new insights on the advantages and disadvantages of certain actions mid game. I believe the latter types of insights can also be very helpful for Valorant gameplay, since at the end of the day these are both tactical shooters with the same objectives and win conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, one of the biggest arguments against Valorant is that CS:GO's maps are designed better. In Valorant, some maps are known to be heavily defense sided, making it very hard for the team that starts on the attack side to win. The data downloaded also included images of CS:GO's official radar maps, and just by taking a quick glance at some of the maps, I do believe that CS:GO's maps are more balanced (i.e. around 50% win rate from both sides).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another insight that I hope to gain is how similar the economy is in CS:GO compared to Valorant. Economy is a huge aspect of Valorant (and I think CS:GO if it pans out similarly). At the start of each round, each team is designated a certain amount of money to spend on weapons and utility (smokes and grenades). The team that won the previous round is rewarded with more money to spend. Players that got kills are also given more money individually. Additionally, the players that did not die the previous round get to keep their weapons and unused utility. This added layer of complexity makes cooperation between teammates a necessity (at least in Valorant). It results in \"save\" rounds where teammates must agree to not buy weapons in hopes that they can buy full loadouts the next round. This is basically a forfeit of the current round (but sometimes still winnable!) to ensure that the struggling team will eventually have the same guns as the enemy team for an even fight (because if you keep losing rounds, eventually you cannot afford to keep buying the more powerful guns). I predict that, despite their differences in utility, there are similar econ patterns in CS:GO as there are in Valorant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last insight I hope to gain is analyzing how first blood (the first kill of a round) affects the round outcome. I think the insights gained here will pertain to both games. My hypothesis is that first blood will affect the outcome, i.e. the team that got the first blood will be more likely to win the round. However, I think that this is only true for the attackers (the \"terrorists\") since the defenders (the \"counter terrorists\") have to control multiple sites. If the attackers get that first kill it will spread out the defenders making it easier to take a site. But if the defenders get the first kill, I predict that it won't matter as much since the attackers can still attack a site that may be only held by 2 or 3 players while they themselves have 4 players.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are 5 different types of datasets included in this data, we will describe each one separately, starting with esea_master_dmg_demos. In total we actually have 7 different dataset types, however, analyzing this game at a high level will offer us better insight to how the game should be played. Therefore, we will ignore the datasets beginning with \"mm\" and only look at the scrim data pertaining to the more professional level players rather than the lower ranked players since their behavior is less likely to coincide with intended gameplay (i.e. lower level players do not know how to play the game correctly).\n",
